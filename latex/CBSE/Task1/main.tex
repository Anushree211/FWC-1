SECTION A

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the value of k for which the roots of the quadratic equation  
$(k-5)x^2 + 2(k-5)x + 2 = 0$ are equal.

\item Find the value of y for which the distance between the points  
$(2,-3)$ and $(10,y)$ is 10 units.

\item Write whether the rational number $13/3125$ has a decimal expansion
which is terminating or non-terminating repeating.

\item Write the nth term of the A.P  
$1/k,\ (1+k)/k,\ (1+2k)/k$.

\item If $\sin\theta + \cos\theta = \sqrt{2}\cos(90^\circ - \theta)$,
find the value of $\cot\theta$.

\item DE is drawn parallel to the base BC of triangle ABC, meeting AB at D
and AC at E. If $AB/CD = 4$ and $CE = 2$ cm, find AE.
\end{enumerate}

SECTION B

\begin{enumerate}
\item A bag contains 5 red balls and some blue balls. If the probability of drawing
a blue ball is three times that of the red ball, find the number of blue balls.

\item The 5th and 15th terms of an A.P are 13 and $-17$. Find the sum of the
first 21 terms of the A.P.

\item Using Euclid’s Division Algorithm, find the HCF of 225 and 867.

\item If the point $(0,2)$ is equidistant from the points $(3,k)$ and $(k,5)$,
find the value of k.

\item Find the value of a for which the pair of linear equations  
$2x + 3y = 7$ and $4x + ay = 14$ has infinitely many solutions.
\end{enumerate}

SECTION C

\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that any positive odd integer is of the form $4q + 1$ or $4q + 3$.

\item The tens digit of a number is twice its units digit. The number obtained
by interchanging the digits is 36 less than the original number.
Find the original number.

\item (i) The line segment joining the points $A(2,1)$ and $B(5,-8)$ is trisected
at points P and Q. If P lies on the line $2x - y + k = 0$, find k.

OR

(ii) The x-coordinate of a point is twice its y-coordinate. If the point is
equidistant from $(2,-5)$ and $(-3,6)$, find its coordinates.

\item Show that $1,\ 1/2$ and $-2$ are the zeroes of the polynomial  
$2x^3 + x^2 - 5x + 2$.

\item Prove that the angle between two tangents drawn from an external point
to a circle is supplementary to the angle subtended at the centre.

\item S and T are points on sides PR and QR of triangle PQR such that  
angle P equals angle RTS. Show that triangle RPQ is similar to triangle RTS.
